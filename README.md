## 🛠 About Me
I'm a self-directed learner diving into cybersecurity while building strong foundations in finance and data workflows. I enjoy using tech to simplify, secure, and streamline financial processes. Whether automating spreadsheets, exploring CTFs, or creating tools that save time—I'm always working on smarter solutions. I am a beginner but I love to find my place in this vast industry and learn all I can!

Currently developing my GitHub portfolio with a mix of security, automation, and financial analysis projects.
