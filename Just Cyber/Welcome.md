**ðŸ¤™ Hey There & Welcome to this wicked crazy cyber adventure!
**
The goal here is to learn the foundtations of IT and cybersecurity before diving into the __meat and potatoes_ of the cybersecurity domain. 

I am following Osher Astorâ€™s **Zero2Hero** syllabus- basically a roadmap that lays out the **core knowledge requirements anyone would need trying to pursuing a career in cybersecurity**.

Based on this Zero2Hero document, the plan is to go through o**ne topic each week**(maybe it will take more), but taking time to truly understand all the subtopics, and then write about what Iâ€™ve learned by the end of the week. Iâ€™ll post each topic breakdown here as I go!


I will be documenting the process through each of the topics sharing what articles, journals, videos that were used. 

I know that the best why to studying to trying to teach it back. So take this as a beginnerâ€™s journey â€” Iâ€™m new to this, but Iâ€™m eager to learn, and Iâ€™d love for you to come learn with me. And we'll have a lot of fun along the way :)
